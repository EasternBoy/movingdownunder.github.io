# Visas

If you require a working visa, you'll need to ensure you satisfy the requirements set out by the Australian immigration
department before you commence our recruitment process. Click [here](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visa-1/482-) to find the most current information relating to the
482 visa.
Once your visa is approved, you can get started setting up things you'll need for life in Australia. For more
information on 482 visas, please visit the FAQs section.

# Bank Account

You're able to open a bank account online before you arrive; all you need is your passport, visa grant letter and
signed employment contract to get started. To compare which bank is best for you check out some comparison sites such
as [Canstar](https://www.canstar.com.au/transaction-accounts/). Once you arrive you'll need to go into the Bank and activate the account by depositing some money and then
you can collect your bank cards which will be ready for you.

# Tax File Number

In Australia, your Tax File Number tracks your tax liability across employers. Without one, 50% of your pay is withheld
by the tax department, so you're going to want to get one sorted, so you can get taxed at an appropriate rate. You'll
want to prepare your TFN application as early as possible so that it's ready in time for your first payday. If your
visa is a class 482 you'll be able to apply whilst youâ€™re abroad. If not, you'll need to wait until you arrive, but do make it one of the first things you do so there are no delays with your first
pay. You can register [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-file-number/Apply-for-a-TFN/Foreign-passport-holders,-permanent-migrants-and-temporary-visitors---TFN-application/).

# Superannuation

Superannuation is a way to save for your retirement. The money comes from compulsory contributions made into your super fund by your employer. Generally, 9.5% of your salary goes into a super fund and this will gradually
increase to 12% in coming years.

There are multiple superannuation funds available, and it is best to do your own research on this. We suggest having a
look at this [comparison website](https://www.canstar.com.au/superannuation/) to aid you in your research.

# Accommodation

We recommend trialling a variety of suburbs before locking yourself into a rental agreement. [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com.au) is a popular option as it's economical and you can trial a few places quickly.
For your first week, we recommend making things as easy as possible and choosing a location close to the office. Once you start with us you can chat to the team about where to try next. There's also another great site to try: <http://www.cityhobo.com/shoe-index/shoe-index>.

If you're coming to Australia with your family, you may prefer to book a serviced apartment. These can be expensive but if you go a bit further out of the city you'll find it's much more economical. However, be sure to stay close to a train line or an easy bus route. You can try booking.com or uniqueshortstays.com.au to see what's available. If you were thinking of trying to get ahead and liaising with real estate agents whilst you're abroad, you may not have much luck as properties are in high demand and agents are generally not open to the idea. Your best option is either wait until you arrive, or get the help of a friend if possible.

Pro tip from us, if you have a family, come alone at first and rent shared rooms to save money and once you decide where your family will settle you can rent a property. The money saved from initial months will help pay all the upfront costs involved in renting a property.

# Schools & Day-care

If you're relocating with children, you'll want to connect with someone who's recently settled their kids into a local school & day care to help your decision-making process. Once you've been offered a role with us, let us know and we can make sure we connect you with the right person.

# Laptops

You'll may need one when you start working. Spend some time researching which model and make you want. You can check out <http://www.powerbuy.com.au> which has deals on Lenovo, Dell, HP Laptops.
