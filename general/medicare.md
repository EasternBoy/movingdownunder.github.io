# Medicare (universal health care)

If your home country has the reciprocal health care arrangement you can apply for Medicare, our publicly funded universal health care system in Australia.
If you have arrived on a permanent residency visa you may also apply for Medicare. Information on the application process can be found [here](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/medicare-card/enrol/how-enrol-or-re-enrol){:target="\_blank"}

If you earn $90,000 (singles) or$180,000 (families), for every year after 30 years of age, you will attract an increasing Medicare levy surcharge and this will be deducted from your salary.
