# Accommodation We recommend trialling a variety of suburbs before locking

yourself into a rental agreement. [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com.au){:target="\_blank"} is a
popular option as it's economical and you can trial a few places quickly. For
your first week, we recommend making things as easy as possible and choosing a
location close to the office. Once you start with us you can chat to the team
about where to try next. There's also another great site to try:

with your family, you may prefer to book a serviced apartment. These can be
expensive but if you go a bit further out of the city you'll find it's much more
economical. However, be sure to stay close to a train line or an easy bus route.
You can try booking.com or uniqueshortstays.com.au to see what's available. If
you were thinking of trying to get ahead and liaising with real estate agents
whilst you're abroad, you may not have much luck as properties are in high
demand and agents are generally not open to the idea. Your best option is either
wait until you arrive, or get the help of a friend if possible. Pro tip from us,
if you have a family, come alone at first and rent shared rooms to save money
and once you decide where your family will settle you can rent a property. The
money saved from initial months will help pay all the upfront costs involved in
renting a property.
