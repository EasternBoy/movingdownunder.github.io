# Income Tax

**_As we are not in the business of tax or immigration advice, please do not rely on the following information exclusively._**

Based on the information made available from the Australian Tax Office, if you are on a 482 Visa and have made steps to make Australia your home (intend to stay, have settled here etc.) then you are considered a resident for tax purposes. This information is based on the following fact sheets:

- <https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/international-tax-for-individuals/work-out-your-tax-residency/>{:target="\_blank"}
- <https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/ind/resident-for-tax-if-whm-/>{:target="\_blank"}

Therefore as a 482 visa holder (and especially once you apply for permanent residency), you would likely be taxed on resident rates, not non-resident rates.

# Tax File Number (TFN)

In Australia, your Tax File Number tracks your tax liability across employers. Without one, 50% of your pay is withheld
by the tax department, so you're going to want to get one sorted, so you can get taxed at an appropriate rate. You'll
want to prepare your TFN application as early as possible so that it's ready in time for your first payday. If your
visa is a class 482 you'll be able to apply whilst youâ€™re abroad. If not, you'll need to wait until you arrive, but do make it one of the first things you do so there are no delays with your first
pay. You can register [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-file-number/Apply-for-a-TFN/Foreign-passport-holders,-permanent-migrants-and-temporary-visitors---TFN-application/){:target="\_blank"}.
