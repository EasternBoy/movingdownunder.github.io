# Tax File Number

In Australia, your Tax File Number tracks your tax liability across employers. Without one, 50% of your pay is withheld
by the tax department, so you're going to want to get one sorted, so you can get taxed at an appropriate rate. You'll
want to prepare your TFN application as early as possible so that it's ready in time for your first payday. If your
visa is a class 482 you'll be able to apply whilst youâ€™re abroad. If not, you'll need to wait until you arrive, but do make it one of the first things you do so there are no delays with your first
pay. You can register [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-file-number/Apply-for-a-TFN/Foreign-passport-holders,-permanent-migrants-and-temporary-visitors---TFN-application/).
