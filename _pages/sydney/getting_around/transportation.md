# Public Transport

Get an Opal card, most convenience stores will sell you one. Once purchased, register it and check [the website](https://www.opal.com.au/){:target="\_blank"} for how to use it and how you can save on travels by planning your trips wisely.

You can also order opal card online and get it delivered to an address in Sydney - if you have already found a place before coming to Sydney. In this instance, your card should be pre-activated.

Trains, Buses and Ferries are the main forms of public transport in Sydney. Traffic can be crazy, so trains are generally more reliable. You'll need an ["Opal" transport card](https://transportnsw.info/tickets-opal/opal#/login){:target="\_blank"} to pay for your public transport. You can buy these from your closest 7-Eleven, Sydney airport station, and machines on some station platforms. There are single-use Opal tickets available, but they're much more expensive, so we recommend to just get your Opal straight away.

## Mobile Applications
Mobile phone applications exist on the [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/){:target="\_blank"} and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store){:target="\_blank"} that track live timetable changes (mostly delays) for trains and busses.

A popular one is [TripView](https://transportnsw.info/apps/tripview){:target="\_blank"} that supports trains, busses, and ferries. You can find a list of all applications [here](https://transportnsw.info/apps){:target="\_blank"}.
