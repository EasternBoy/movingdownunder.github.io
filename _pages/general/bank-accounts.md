# Bank Account

You're able to open a bank account online before you arrive; all you need is your passport, visa grant letter and
signed employment contract to get started. To compare which bank is best for you check out some comparison sites such
as [Canstar](https://www.canstar.com.au/transaction-accounts/){:target="\_blank"}. Once you arrive you'll need to go into the Bank and activate the account by depositing some money and then
you can collect your bank cards which will be ready for you.
