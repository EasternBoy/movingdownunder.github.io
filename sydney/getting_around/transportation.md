# Public Transport

Trains, Buses and Ferries are the main forms of public transport in Sydney. Traffic can be crazy, so trains are generally more reliable. You'll need an ["Opal" transport card](https://transportnsw.info/tickets-opal/opal#/login){:target="\_blank"} to pay for your public transport. You can buy these from your closest 7-Eleven, Sydney airport station, and machines on some station platforms. There are single-use Opal tickets available, but they're much more expensive, so we recommend to just get your Opal straight away.
