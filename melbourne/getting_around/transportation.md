# Public Transport

Trains and trams are the primary forms of public transport in Melbourne. You'll need a ["Myki"](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki){:target="\_blank"} transport card to pay for your public transport. You can buy these from your closest 7-Eleven. There are no single/paper tickets. In Melbourne, you'll hear the terms "Touch on" and "Touch off", this means when you get on the tram/train or bus, you'll need to swipe your card on the Myki reader either on the platform or in the tram/bus. When you get off, you generally need to "Touch off" to get the cheapest fare. To help you plan your routes, you can download the PTV (Public Transport Victoria) app or use Google Maps (within which, there is a public transport option).

Once you've purchased a Myki card, you can register it on the PTV (Public Transport Victoria) site and also [setup auto top-ups](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/top-up-a-myki/){:target="\_blank"} to be effected when your Myki balance reaches a predefined threshold.

## FYI on Trams

Trams operate close to the city and run throughout the day. Inside the Melbourne CBD exists a "free tram zone"; trips entirely within this zone are free. You only need to Touch On if your journey is headed outside this zone.

Just because you catch a tram on the road you want to be on, don't assume it will remain on that road. Trams turn, and you may end up somewhere completely different. In the PTV app, there are transport maps. Look at the trams map and take the tram number that will take you where you want to go (any no other trams number).
