# Welcome Down Under

The information here is intended to fast-track your move to Australia and we've tried to make the information and
relevant to the just the main cities as possible.
Initially, my [Readify](https://readify.net) co-workers and I started putting together content to help others that
followed our footsteps but, we wanted to make this useful information available to everyone.
Think of it as paying forward all the help we received from others over the years.

That, in turn, leads to your obligation to do the same. Contribute to this information even in the smallest of ways by
heading to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/movingdownunder) and making changes.

Enjoy your new life in Australia. Become a productive member of society and help make everyone's life better!
